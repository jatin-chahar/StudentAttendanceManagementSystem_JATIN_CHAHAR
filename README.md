# Student Attendance Management System

## Overview
The **Student Attendance Management System** is a web application that helps educational institutions track student attendance. Teachers can mark attendance for their classes, and students can view their attendance records. The system is designed to replace paper-based attendance tracking with a more efficient and accurate digital solution.

## Features
- **Add Students**: Teachers can add new students to the system.
- **Mark Attendance**: Teachers can mark attendance for students on specific dates.
- **View Attendance**: Teachers and administrators can view the attendance records for all students.
- **Database-Driven**: The project uses MySQL to store student and attendance data.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites:
- Install **Python** and **MySQL** on your system.
- Install necessary Python libraries by running the following command:

  ```bash
  pip install flask pymysql

Running the App:
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Set up the MySQL database by running the following commands in MySQL:
CREATE DATABASE AttendanceDB;
USE AttendanceDB;

CREATE TABLE Student (
    StudentID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Email VARCHAR(100),
    ClassID INT
);

CREATE TABLE Class (
    ClassID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    ClassName VARCHAR(100),
    TeacherID INT
);

CREATE TABLE Attendance (
    AttendanceID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    StudentID INT,
    ClassID INT,
    Date DATE,
    Status VARCHAR(10),
    FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Student(StudentID),
    FOREIGN KEY (ClassID) REFERENCES Class(ClassID)
);

Replace your MySQL credentials in the app.py file:

db = pymysql.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="root",
    passwd="your_password",  # Replace with your MySQL password
    db="AttendanceDB"
)

In your terminal, navigate to the project folder and run the following command:

python app.py

Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to access the app.

Technologies Used
Flask: Python web framework used to create the backend.
MySQL: Database used to store attendance and student data.
HTML/CSS: Front-end for displaying forms and data.

How to Use
Home Page: On the homepage, you can navigate to different pages: Add Student, Mark Attendance, and View Attendance.
Add Student: You can add students by filling in their name, email, and class ID.
Mark Attendance: Teachers can mark attendance by selecting the student, class, and date, and choosing whether the student was present or absent.
View Attendance: The attendance records will be displayed in a table showing Student ID, Class ID, Date, and Status.
Future Improvements
Add user authentication (teacher login).
Include attendance analytics (e.g., trends and patterns).
Add a feature to edit or delete student records.
